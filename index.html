    <td>Rational and irrational bias in recommendation <b>(17:00 GMT+10)</b></td>
    <td>Concern for bias in IR has grown considerably in the last few years, and recommender systems are a particular area where applications and experiments are immersed in bias. I will discuss some general angles on the biases that pervade recommendation, and what researchers are doing about it. I will follow up into some of my particular experience and findings in better understanding the effect of popularity biases on the effectiveness of recommendation and our capability to properly measure it in offline evaluation. I will discuss how the positive or negative effect of popularity in recommendation relates to the role of relevance in users' discoveries and choices, and in the formation of majorities, sometimes in non-obvious ways.</td>

    <td> Internet searching and stock price crash risk: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment</td>
    <td>In 2010, Google unexpectedly withdrew its searching business from China, reducing investors’ ability to find information online. The stock price crash risk for firms searched for more via Google before its withdrawal subsequently increases by 19%, suggesting that Internet searching facilitates investors’ information processing. The sensitivity of stock returns to negative Internet posts also rises by 36%. The increase in crash risk is more pronounced when firms are more likely to hide adverse information and when information intermediaries are less effective in assisting investors’ information processing. In addition, liquidity (price delay) decreases (increases) after Google's withdrawal.</td>

    <td>An Enhanced Evaluation Framework for Query Performance Prediction</td>
    <td>Query Performance Prediction (QPP) has been studied extensively in the IR community over the last two decades. A by-product of this research is a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of QPP techniques. In this paper, we re-examine the existing evaluation methodology commonly used for QPP, and propose a new approach. Our key idea is to model QPP performance as a distribution instead of relying on point estimates. Our work demonstrates important statistical implications, and overcomes key limitations imposed by the currently used correlation-based point-estimate evaluation approaches. We also explore the potential benefits of using multiple query formulations and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) modelling in order to measure interactions between multiple factors. The resulting statistical analysis combined with a novel evaluation framework demonstrates the merits of modelling QPP performance as distributions, and enables detailed statistical ANOVA models for comparative analyses to be created.</td>

    <td>Do affective cues validate behavioural metrics for search?</td>
    <td>Traces of searcher behaviour, such as query reformulation or clicks, are commonly used to evaluate a running search engine. The underlying expectation is that these behaviours are proxies for something more important, such as relevance, utility, or satisfaction. Affective computing technology gives us the tools to help confirm some of these expectations, by examining visceral expressive responses during search sessions. However, work to date has only studied small populations in laboratory settings and with a limited number of contrived search tasks.
In this study, we analysed longitudinal, in-situ, search behaviours of 152 information workers, over the course of several weeks while simultaneously tracking their facial expressions. Results from over 20,000 search sessions and 45,000 queries allow us to observe that indeed affective expressions are consistent with, and complementary to, existing “click-based” metrics. On a query level, searches that result in a short dwell time are associated with a decrease in smiles (expressions of “happiness”) and that if a query is reformulated the results of the reformulation are associated with an increase in smiling – suggesting a positive outcome as people converge on the information they need. On a session level, sessions that feature reformulations are more commonly associated with fewer smiles and more furrowed brows (expressions of “anger/frustration”). Similarly, sessions with short-dwell clicks are also associated with fewer smiles. These data provide an insight into visceral aspects of search experience and present a new dimension for evaluating engine performance.

    <td>LGBTQ+ individuals’ information seeking and sharing in an online community</td>
    <td>Individuals with LGBTQ+ identities are at risk of negative outcomes due to their highly stigmatized sexual and gender minority status. Online communities are especially important to this population group, as they provide a safe and validating space for building interpersonal connections and fostering a sense of belonging. Focused on the affective and motivational aspects of LGBTQ+ individuals’ information behaviour, our work investigates the emotions LGBTQ+ individuals expressed, and their relatedness needs that motivated them to seek and share information in an online community. Through a deductive thematic analysis of 156 posts to an LGBTQ+ online forum, our analysis reveals three main categories of relatedness needs: being cared about, caring for others, as well as building and maintaining relationships. Sixty-one posts that contained emotional texts were further coded to analyse the emotions expressed by LGBTQ+ individuals. Seven categories of emotions emerged from the analysis: fear, uncertainty, sadness, anger, shame, joy, and others. Our work contributes to the existing knowledge of how LGBTQ+ individuals cope with various challenges and how online communities can better support sexual and gender minority people. Future work will investigate the influence of their information behaviour on their resilience and affordances implications for LGBTQ+ online community design. </td>

    <td>Analysing Clarification in Asynchronous Information Seeking Conversations</td>
    <td>This research analyses human-generated clarification questions to provide insights into how they are used to disambiguate and provide a better understanding of information needs. A set of clarification questions is extracted from posts on the Stack Exchange platform. Novel taxonomy is defined for the annotation of the questions and their responses. Our results indicate that questions answered by the person who submitted the original post (the asker) are more likely to be informative and to increase the chance of getting an accepted answer. After identifying which clarification questions are more useful, we investigate the characteristics of these questions in terms of their types and patterns. Non-useful clarification questions are identified, and their patterns are compared with useful clarifications. Our analysis indicates that the most useful clarification questions have similar patterns, regardless of topic. This research contributes to an understanding of clarification in conversations and can provide insight for clarification dialogues in conversational search scenarios and for the possible system generation of clarification requests in information seeking conversations.</td>

    <td>A taxonomy of non-factoid questions</td>
    <td>Non-factoid question answering (NFQA) is a challenging task where a system should return complex long-form answers (such as explanations or opinions) to open-ended questions. Although researchers are working on datasets and systems in this area, so far the performance of the latter falls far behind systems created to answer factoid questions. The reason could be that the form of answers that an ideal NFQA system should return varies greatly depending on the category of asked question.
In our study, we propose the first comprehensive non-factoid question taxonomy constructed by employing grounded theory and extensively evaluated via several crowdsourcing studies. Along with taxonomy, we provide a dataset of non-factoid question categories and a performant model for question category prediction. Both will be made publicly available to the research community. Finally, we conducted an analysis of non-factoid question category distribution in various existing QA and conversational datasets, showing that the most challenging question categories for the existing NFQA systems are poorly represented in these datasets.
We believe that a better understanding of question categories of non-factoid questions and the structure of target answers will greatly aid the research in this area.</td>

    <td>Time Series Change Point Detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Predictive Coding</td>
    <td>Change Point Detection (CPD) methods identify the times associated with changes in the trends and properties of time series data in order to describe the underlying behaviour of the system. For instance, detecting the changes and anomalies associated with web service usage, application usage or human behaviour can provide valuable insights for downstream modelling tasks. We propose a novel approach for self-supervised Time Series Change Point detection method based on Contrastive Predictive coding (TS-CP^2). TS-CP^2 is the first approach to employ a contrastive learning strategy for CPD by learning an embedded representation that separates pairs of embeddings of time adjacent intervals from pairs of interval embeddings separated across time. Through extensive experiments on three diverse, widely used time series datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms five state-of-the-art CPD methods, which include unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. TS-CP^2 is shown to improve the performance of methods that use either handcrafted statistical or temporal features by 79.4% and deep learning-based methods by 17.0% with respect to the F1-score averaged across the three datasets.</td>

    <td>How Do You Test a Test? Examining Significance from Different Angles</td>
    <td>In this talk, I will describe a suite of measures, which are jointly used to investigate a recently proposed ANOVA model based significance test and to compare it to two well-known baselines. I will apply the measures to the both the runs of a TREC track, and to the runs submitted by single participants. The former reveals test behaviour in the heterogeneous settings of a large-scale evaluation initiative, the latter lets us know what happens in the much more restricted case of variants of a single system. The results of our study show the novel ANOVA model to be substantially better than a commonly used significance test found in many IR researcher papers.</td>

        <td>Research on Podcasts at Spotify</td>
        <td>Podcasts are a large and growing repository of spoken audio. As an audio format, podcasts are more varied in style and production type than broadcast news, contain more genres than typically studied in video data, and are more varied in style and format than previous corpora of conversations. When transcribed with automatic speech recognition they represent a noisy but fascinating collection of documents which can be studied through the lens of natural language processing, information retrieval, and linguistics. Paired with the audio files, they are also a resource for speech processing and the study of acoustic aspects of the domain. We introduce the Spotify Podcast Dataset, a new corpus of 100,000 podcasts. We demonstrate the complexity of the domain with a case study of two tasks drawn from information retrieval and NLP: (1) passage search and (2) summarization. This data is orders of magnitude larger than previous speech corpora used for search and summarization. Our results show that the size and variability of this corpus opens up new avenues for research. I’ll discuss some of those avenues, as well as giving a brief overview of research on podcasts and music at Spotify.</td>

        <td>Towards Realistic and Reproducible Off-Policy Evaluation: Open-Source Dataset, Software, and Application in Fashion E-Commerce Recommendation</td>
        <td>There is a growing interest in off-policy evaluation (OPE) or offline evaluation in web search and data mining; we have witnessed great research progress over the past decade. There is, however, a critical issue in the current OPE research; all existing experiments are either unrealistic or irreproducible, creating the gap between theory and practice. To break this gap and push forward OPE to a tangible method, we are running an open-source research project called the Open Bandit Project. The project includes Open Bandit Dataset and Open Bandit Pipeline. The Open Bandit Dataset is a real-world public dataset collected on the ZOZOTOWN platform, the largest fashion e-commerce in Japan. The dataset is unique; it contains two sets of log data collected by running multiple different recommendation policies, enabling fair comparisons of different OPE methods for the first time. We also implement a Python software, Open Bandit Pipeline, to streamline and standardize the implementation of OPE both in research and practice. In this talk, I will share the basic formulation and discuss current issues in OPE research. Then, I will introduce our open-source project and show a proof of concept live demonstration about OPE with our software. Finally, I will talk about some real-world applications in the ZOZOTOWN recommendation interface.</td>
